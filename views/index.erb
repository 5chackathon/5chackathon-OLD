                        <h6>What is a hackathon?</h6>
                        <p>According to Wikipedia, a hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is an event in which computer programmers and others in the field of software development, like graphic designers, interface designers and project managers collaborate intensively on software projects. We like to define is a little more casually: a 12 hour time period where you get the chance to build whatever you want.</p>
                        <h6>Do I need to be able to code to participate?</h6>
                        <p>It definitely helps, but designers (and motivated product people) are also essential parts of successful hackathon teams. Plus, if you don't know how to code (or don't know how to apply the skills you've learned in classes to the real world), come to <a href='#hack-week'>Hack Week</a> and we'll teach you!</p>
                        <h6>Why is it overnight?</h6>
                        <p>Because doing things overnight is way more badass. Plus, it means no distractions (no one else is awake).</p>
                        <h6>Why should I participate?</h6>
                        <p>When was the last time you built something amazing? Something that wowed your friends and family? Something that you could be proud of? Something that you could put on your resume, which would earn you the eternal stamp of 'badass'? Now's your chance to answer all of those questions in a single night. Plus, we'll have tons of food, crazy cool prizes, and a whole collection of amazing people.</p>
                        <h6>Food and prizes, you say?</h6>
                        <p>Yes, lots of food and lots of prizes. Foodwise, we plan to have as many energy drinks as you could ever want, tons of fresh fruit, pizza, kripsy kreme, ice cream, coffee, bagels and cream cheese, orange juice, and tons more. Check out the <a href="#prizes">Prizes</a> section for more information on the prizes.

                        <h6>What is hack week?</h6>
                        <p>Hack week is a week long tutorial on how to build a full featured web application. From python to HTML, CSS to javascript, we'll get you up and running so you can come out and win the hackathon.</p>
                        <h6>When is hack week?</h6>
                        <p>Hack week is every night from 7-9pm during the week of April 8th-12th, culminating in the 5C Hackathon.</p>
                        <h6>Where is hack week?</h6>
                        <p>Hack week is held in room 114 of Edmunds, the Pomona Computer Science building.</p>
                        <h6>What specific skills will I learn?</h6>
                        <p>Everything you need to know to build a dynamic web application (or as much as we can teach you in 10 hours). We'll cover HTML/CSS, writing server side code in Python with Flask, designing front end interactions with javascript, deploying your web application with Heroku, and managing (and collaborating with others on) your code with Git and Github.</p>
                        <h6>Do I need to come to every night?</h6>
                        <p>If you don't come to every night, we can't guarantee that you won't be lost.</p>
                        <h6>I don't think I can do this alone!</h6>
                        <p>You won't be doing it alone! On Monday, we'll put everyone in pairs, so you can have a teammate to help you work through all the hard parts (one more reason to come every day). Plus, once the two of you have conquered hack week (think hell week, jklolz), you'll be the ideal duo to win the hackathon!</p>
