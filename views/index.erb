                        <h6>What is a hackathon?</h6>
                        <p>According to Wikipedia, a hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is an event in which computer programmers and others in the field of software development, like graphic designers, interface designers and project managers collaborate intensively on software projects. We like to define it a little more casually: a 12 hour time period in which you get the chance to build whatever you want.</p>
                        <h6>Do I need to be able to code to participate?</h6>
                        <p>It definitely helps, but designers (and motivated product people) are also essential components of successful hackathon teams. If you don't know how to code (or don't know how to apply the skills you've learned in classes to the real world), come to <a class='gold' href='#hack-week'>Hack Week</a> and we'll teach you!</p>
                        <h6>Why is it overnight?</h6>
                        <p>Because doing things overnight is way more badass. Plus, it means no distractions, freedom to take over the entire building, and the romance of watching the sun rise.</p>
                        <h6>Why should I participate?</h6>
                        <p>When was the last time you built something amazing? Something that wowed your friends and family? Something that you could put on your resume that would earn you the eternal stamp of 'badass'? Now's your chance to answer all of those questions in a single night. Plus, we'll have tons of food, crazy cool prizes, and some first-class people.</p>
                        <h6>Food and prizes, you say?</h6>

                        <p>Yes, lots of food and lots of prizes. We plan to have more energy drinks than you could ever want, mountains of pizza, fresh fruit, Krispy Kreme, ice cream, coffee, tomatoes, bagels, orange juice, and tons more. <!-- Check out the <a class='gold' href="#prizes">Prizes</a> section for more information on the prizes. -->

                        <h6>What is hack week?</h6>
                        <p>Hack week is a weeklong tutorial on how to build a full-featured web application from the ground up. From Python to HTML, CSS to JavaScript, we'll get you up and running so that when it comes time for the hackathon, you can build something awesome.</p>
                        <h6>When is hack week?</h6>
                        <p>Hack week is every night from 7-9pm during the week of April 8th-12th, culminating in the 5C Hackathon.</p>
                        <h6>Where is hack week?</h6>
                        <p>Hack week is held in Edmunds 101, the Pomona Computer Science building.</p>
                        <h6>What specific skills will I learn?</h6>
                        <p>Everything you need to know to build a dynamic web application (or as much as we can teach you in 10 hours). We'll cover writing HTML/CSS, writing server-side code in Python with Flask, designing frontend interactions with JavaScript, deploying your web application with Heroku, and managing/collaborating on your code with Git and Github.</p>
                        <h6>Do I need to come to every night?</h6>
                        <p>To guarantee that you leave with the skills and confidence to build a web app on your own, we highly encourage that you attend the entire week of tutorials. However, we understand that you may have other commitments, so we will provide starter code at the start of each evening to catch you up on what happened the previous night.</p>
                        <h6>I don't think I can do this alone!</h6>
                        <p>You won't be doing it alone! On Monday, we'll put everyone in pairs so you can have a teammate to help you work through all the hard parts (one more reason to come every day). Plus, once the two of you have conquered hack week (think hell week, jklolz), you'll be the ideal duo to win the hackathon!</p>

From easy ways to collaborate on code with your teammates to geographically-oriented data that can drive your application, these resources can save you a lot of time and effort so that you can focus on the important stuff. Plus, you might win some bonus points with the judges if you use their company's API.</p>
                        <h6>But how do I use them?</h6>
                        <p>There are almost always easy-to-follow instructions with worked-out examples on the company's website. We'll also be incorporating several of these tools into <a class='orange' href='#hack-week'>Hack Week</a> so you can see them in action. Even better, we'll have representatives from our sponsors at the hackathon who will be more than happy to answer questions about their developer tools and APIs!</p>
